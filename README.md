# StressLess

StressLess is a mobile app designed to help people who struggle with addictions, eating disorders, high stress, anxiety, and depression. In a panic state, a user can press a red panic button that (1) sends a text message to 3 contacts specified in Settings and (2) gives the user a chance to check in and review defenses, triggers, moods, and thoughts. Users can view their responses and see trends over time, giving them more insight and control over their life.
